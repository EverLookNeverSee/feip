## React Forms:

**What are uncontrolled components?**  
They are components that store their own state and are updated using refs. They are often used for simple form inputs,
where manging the state in a parent component would be unnecessary overhead.

**What are controlled components?**  
They are components that store their state in a parent component and are updated using the setState() method. The
parent component passes down the component's state as props and also passes down a function to update the state when
needed. This approach allows for more control over the component's behaviour and simplifies debugging.
