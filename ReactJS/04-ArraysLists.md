## React Arrays and Lists:

**What is *key* prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?**  
The “key” prop in React is a special prop that provides a unique identifier for each element in an array
of elements. It is used to optimize the performance of rendering by allowing React to identify, which
elements have changed, and to update only those elements instead of re-rendering the entire list. The “key”
prop should be unique stable identifier for each element, such as an ID or index.
